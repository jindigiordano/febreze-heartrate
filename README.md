# Scentsational

A stress management app that integrates the Febreze Home smart air freshener with the Google Home personal Assistant, using voice commands and time and heart rate data to trigger the release of calming scents when you return home from work, energizing scents with your morning alarm, and soothing scents when it approaches your bedtime. Also has use cases for patients with dementia to trigger memories and slow degeneration.

## Created in 30 hours during the Febreze Home Hackathon sponsored by Proctor and Gamble and hosted by AngelHack. 

## Placed in the top 6 finalists.
